# Your Vinaya Notes Module

**Fork this reprository to create your own Vinaya Notes Module!**

## Steps

1. Fork this repo
2. Fill in the `metadata.yaml` file with your folder's information
3. Update this `README.md` with your own introduction
4. Copy over your notes
5. When you're ready, set the "if" in `.github/workflows/release.yaml` to "true"
6. Commit and push
7. You'll see a new release created with your notes and a `.vnm` file

## How it works

This repo comes with a GitHub Actions script (at .github/workflows/release.yaml)
which will automatically create a new GitHub Release with your Module every time
you push to the `main` branch.

Your latest .vnm file will always live at https://github.com/{{ your repo }}/releases/latest/download/manifest.vnm

## Customization

If you'd like to make a notes module with a custom build step, just modify the release.yaml file to add whatever build steps you need.
Just be sure to point the vinaya-notes-module-releaser step to the path of the folder you'd like to publish (and to the metadata yaml file if it's not in $path).
